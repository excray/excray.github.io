Kind of feeling homesick right now. I want to talk to mom but she must have slept now. Hmmm, Now i have to wait another seven hours. Aaaaaargh.<div><br /></div><div>Life suddenly has turned super hectic. The first week, i fell sick just by realizing the imminent load of graduate studies. But somehow, the next couple of weeks have gone well. "Well", in a sense, that time has been managed just right. But i wish i had some breathing space.</div><div><br /></div><div>This place is very beautiful. You can see deers straying around here akin to cattle and dogs straying in India(Obligatory Indian reference). There is a wide variety of flora and fauna. The squirrels here are so huge, fed copiously by the squirrel feeding club here. And i find a lot of these bush animals whose names i have no idea of. They just skirt past the road in a flash, evoking that rare moment of peacefulness within me.</div><div><br /></div><div>I am beginning to like the part time job at Bursley canteen. Not few weeks i wanted to quit, but now iam beginning to enjoy it. It's probably be going to be my only job away from a PC. Well now the real reason is, i get to eat awesome unlimited amount of food for 4 bucks!</div>
