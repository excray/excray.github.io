<div style="text-align: justify;">So for the career development program at our office, Capt Gopinath and Javagal Srinath were the two speakers who were invited for the guest lectures. Its been a really long time since i listened to a motivational speech as wonderful as this. Thoroughly enjoyed it and i wanted to pen it down so that i dont forget it in the course of my life.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Capt Gopinath's speech more or less touched upon his own life. His childhood, life in the army, life as a farmer, life as a entrepreneur which began as a motorcycle dealer and now he is the owner of the aviation company, Air Deccan. His life was a really interesting story and also a long one. His tenacity, problem solving skills and the will to never give up was something to learn from. He constantly kept stressing upon everyone to never give up. As he was saying this, I mused on this old story i had read a long time back about Napoleon Bonaparte. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The story as it goes, Once Napoleon Bonaparte shows his palm to a palmist and asks him if he'll become the general of France. The palmist replies that Napoleon misses a line on his palm and so doesn't have a chance of becoming the general. Napoleon takes a knife, cuts his hand to make the line and shows it to the palmist again. The palmist then says that no one can stop Napoleon from becoming the general.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I must read Capt Gopinath's book "Simply fly". Its not always you hear good stories on life like this.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Javagal Srinath's speech was totally a different ball game. He's a huge man, towering over almost everyone at my office. His speech was humorous without being flippant. While checking amils at home, manager sent a mail saying that Sreenath will be giving a speech. I misread it as Sreesanth and quickly hurried my way to office, only to find that it was a lost cause. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I liked his takes on the players that he has played with. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Srinath on Sachin and why Sachin wasn't successful as a captain.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">"Sachin is a unique player. It's very difficult to work with people who are that talented. He can pull off miracles once in a while. But the problem was that , when he became the captain, he started expecting the same miracles from all his players in the team. The lesser mortals like us were not able to cope up with the expectation"</div></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div></blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">On Ganguly</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">"After Azhar, we lacked a good captain. Azhar was a very withdrawn captain. But when Ganguly became the captain, there was no designation for anyone in the team. We played like a bunch of equals. And thats the best team to work for or play with"</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div></blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">On Dhoni,</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">"Dhoni is a cool captain and knows to manage people excellently. He doesnt act in front of camera which itself is a great act for me!"</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div></blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">On match fixing scandals</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><blockquote>"There's always this first time. If you resist it, 99% of the time you wont become corrupt again."</blockquote></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div><br /></div><div></div>
