<div style="text-align: justify;">So been to Aero India Show with my friends. My grandpa who was in the airforce administration, always wanted me to take to one of these exhibits, but it remained unfulfilled. So there you go Grandpa.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The first half until the noon was a jaw dropping display of daredevilry. What an out of the world experience these pilots are having. Surya Kiran team started off the show by doing all those delta and other myriad formations while spewing out a tail of smoke resembling the indian flag. They even formed a love and arrow formation. Then there was the sukhoi's, super hornet's and Mig, all appearing the same except for few differences for the not so discerning eye. They just rolled their flights like how a crocodile rolls both laterally and vertically. While all the stunts were spectacular, one particular stunt i liked the most was the one done by a group of three flights. One flight goes around the other two in a circular fashion. Like it was doing an aarti. There were these extremely well choreographed stunts of near hits and misses.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Then i went to the play on Friday- Hamlet the clown prince, directed by Rajat Kapoor. Saw Kalki Koechlin. She looked really anemic. Anyway it was a terrific performance by the troupe. Kept the audience in splits most of the time, for over two hours. This must have been a terrific weekend if i was able to go to the Ind-Aus match too. Suresh had an extra ticket but i wasn't able to go. The darn maruti driving school class came in between. I have no idea when they would teach me how to drive a real car. Leave the teaching, when would they allow me to sit in the driver's seat. All those theory, demo, simulator sessions doesnt make any sense to me if they dont give me enough time to practice on the road. </div>
