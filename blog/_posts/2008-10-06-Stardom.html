Here, I am going to tell you the story of a lad who dreamt big, who grew up into a man who chased his dreams and finally became a star for whom sky was never the limit.

...

I had a dream. I saw myself as a star. I dreamt to become one like him, my idol. I allowed the dream to sprout. It sprouted to a vision, fuelled by my own sense of awe. Now I have a vision. I keep having it. To become a STAR. The vision ate up my time, It ate up my thoughts. "You have to become like him. You have to.. ", It keeps ranting. Incessantly. My eyes fall on the poster of the man, my idol. I wonder if he had a vision like the one I have. To become a STAR is not easy. I know. But why live a life where I don’t become what I want to be. I am not a cat. I don’t have nine lives.

I want to become like him, my idol. His style, his foibles, are mine now. He is my second skin. Infatuation turned into passion, wishes turned into hopes. Mama fooled me when she said she'll get me all the stars sprinkled on the sky, if I would gobble one last rice ball, which was never the last one as she promised it to be. If I become a star, my children will never have to be fooled the same way. I'll live my life on my own terms. I'll capture my destiny, future will be my directions.

I grew up. Time was kind to me. I grew up into a fine, healthy oak. Not green, Not withered, but with full of vigor. From now on, every step I take has a purpose, every action I take has a meaning. To become a star. Hindrances came in my way, but my path was clear. I will never waver, like a feather. A feather wavers too fine along its journey. I will not stand still. I'll stand only to tell a tale, but not otherwise. People wanted me to become logical. I never listen to logic. Logic is only an excuse to me.

Many roles fall along, but those chances force me to think of other choices. Then, nature willing, I land on my first BIG chance. The chance, to become a star. I poured everything into it, my efforts, my hopes, my critics, my blessings. What came out of it, were my reflections, my reflections of the past. To become a STAR. I became one. Finally.
Finally, my sweat tastes sweet. Finally I love to remember.

I am now a vortex. I draw fame, people and money. My appetite is insatiable and I see no horizon. Like fire, my pride consumes every obstacle on my path and it grows only bigger, untamed. Ambitions pay scant regard to adversities. I aged, just like a fruit which attracts more flies with age and my fame soared skywards. All the while, I never knew a world beyond tangible assets existed.

Days, months and years rolled by. Now I see the light at the end of the tunnel. In retrospect, I sensed that I was a loan shark. I was always asking life to pay me the right dividends, but never observed if I was paying something to it. No regrets, I lived my life on my own terms. Cry I may, but weep, i.will.not.

It all started with a rice ball.
