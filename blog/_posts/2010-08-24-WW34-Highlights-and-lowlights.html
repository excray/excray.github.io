Hmmm..<div><br /></div><div>To begin with, nothing earth shattering happened.</div><div><br /></div><div>So the weekend was spent at Trichy/Coimbatore. Enjoyed the hospitability of Gopal.  I wanted to go to Tanjore but that didnt materialize. Attended Jeffrey's wedding at Trichy. Got him a creative 2.1 speaker. Hopefully it works. Iam skeptical because i saw chinese language written all over the box. </div><div><br /></div><div>Then i met Mahesh and Allvin after a really long time. Bai was also there. I haven't spoken to Mahesh for like 1.5 years for a reason that i dont know. But a hug just dispelled the tension. </div><div><br /></div><div>Then reached Coimbatore on Sunday. Onam was well spent with my family and relatives. I have definitely gained a kilo or two.</div><div><br /></div><div>Played cricket with my team mates today for the olympics match in our group. The only thing that i was catching consistenly was my breath. I should really get into a shape. I gave 11 runs in an over. Somehow bowling never works for me during a match. I bowl perfectly on the nets, but during the match iam reduced to a Sreesanth minus the antics.</div><div><br /></div><div>Reading fight club. Awesome book i say.. Iam Joe's enlarged sense of rejection. WTF does that mean? Maybe thats why its awesome</div>
