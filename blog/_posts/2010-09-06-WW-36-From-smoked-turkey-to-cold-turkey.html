<div align="justify">Pretty normal week. Nothing alarming that would need my intervention happened. And i like it that way.</div><div align="justify">Iam waiting for the code to compile. Thats any programmer's best way to slack at work. I dont know why, Iam facing decreased motivation levels at work for the past couple of weeks. Iam updating the blog more punctually when compared to my weeklies. Need to pull up my pants. And with my office system being so slow, it aint helping things. Lucky that i have got two desktops. Need to upgrade the OS to win7 to see if it makes my system's and my life any better. What an exciting life!</div><div align="justify">So weekend.. Venkatesh came to my house to prepare the SOP/Reco. Man, the amount of lies that has to be written. Phew! Thank god, Pinocchio is just fiction.</div><div align="justify">So Venki was all gung-ho on trying something different(to eat) for the weekend. Hmmm, thats exactly the kind of company i need. We dashed to a german cuisine. It bore a very relaxed atomosphere. People were standing, sitting, talking and boozing. We got ourselves seated and looked around for servers. No one came to our table for a while. On enquiry found that the cuisine was hosting a private party. Dashed out.</div><div align="justify">Okay then i wanted to try the lebanese fare at World Cuisine network in IndiraNagar. Predicted that it would be very expensive but what the hell.. Before biting the dust, it's better to bite all that the world has to offer. Itwas a roof-top restaurant. Not very plush. It had solids, liquids and gases(hookah) to offer. For the starters, we ordered fila-fil, which i was like our frankie-next-door. Iam sure i have eaten filafil somewhere earlier. Then for the main course, i ordered Saj with smoked turkey and Venki ordered Saj with some veggie stuff. Saj is supposed to mean Arabian bread, but it tasted like pizza base. It was quite bland, not tear-jerkingly spicy, not even close. But it was very filling. The grills were extremly expensive costing upto a ridiculous 550 bucks. So we were left to eat them with our eyes. Just this basic a la carte cost us 400 bucks. </div><div align="justify">Okay the code has finished compiling. Phew 20 minutes it has taken. But more importantly i need to catch the shuttle. The code can wait. </div><div align="justify"> </div>
