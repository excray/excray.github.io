<span ><div style="text-align: justify;"><div style="text-align: justify; "><i><span class="Apple-style-span">This story is about two characters, Daishin and Kokan. Daishin, a buddhist monk, disavows his spiritual beliefs and decides to spend the rest of his life seeking reality. Kokan, once an affluent trader, heartbroken on seeing his possessions fall under the hammer, withdraws himself from reality and goes on a quest to become a monk. What would happen if their antithetical paths are crossed?</span></i></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">'Here Iam, on the rooooof of the world', shouted Daishin who was perched precariously on Nyainen peak, the highest peak in the holy city of Lhasa. He has been shouting these words for a long time now. His vocal chords has turned stiff. By constantly uttering those words, he wanted to erase the blasphemous thoughts of running away from his monastery. After some time, no matter how loud he shouted, he found his false pride about his birthplace withering away. He paused to gaze at the mountains that has been hugging his city, he calls it a bondage while others perceive it as protection. Daishin longed to fly above these mountains, get rid of his spiritual garb and experience freedom. Knowing the kind of life he has led, he wasn't sure if this was possible. But at that moment, he felt a surge so strong that he knew the mountains would crumble to let him do his bidding. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">Daishin is the only child of a devout buddhist couple, who earned their livelihood by selling merchandise and souvenirs to the few tourists who visit Lhasa. Daishin was three years old, when his parents enrolled him to the monastery. Bells and prayer wheels were his toys. When Daishin grew older, he started to assist his parents in their trade. The tourists were eager to talk to this starry-eyed monk who shared their enthusiasm in equal measure. It was from these tourists that Daishin got a glimpse of what the outer world would actually look like, a world starkly different from his own. Unlike his world that stood the test of time with much disdain, the world from where these tourists came from was always changing. He noticed the shifting urban landscapes each time the tourists handed him over the photographs of their homelands. It was as if those places kept changing their masks every now and then.  Few years after his parent's death, Daishin became increasingly restless. He wanted to lose his loneliness among the festive crowds in Calcutta, he longed to climb to the top of Eiffel tower and his wishlist started getting longer. He regretted his life that shunned all forms of materialism, a life that has been tuned to follow a strict code of ethics, a life that has laid a clear demarcation between good and bad. ' Of course, who are these people to decide what's good for my life. I went to the monastery by design, not by choice', Daishin thought. But two decades of a rigid monastic upbringing is not going to be easy to be forgotten. He intently missed the prayers, faulted his morning prayers and skipped his meditation sessions. While guilt bore him down for a few days, hope of a new exciting life that lay ahead fogged his conscience. Finally when the pricks of guilt could hurt him no more, he knew he was ready to get away. He started planning his getaway from Lhasa. From a tourist, he had learnt of a secret route to India through the Kanchenjunga mountain range. The route was not heavily guarded by border police and Daishin was confident in entering the quaint little town of Darjeeling without any hassle. There he planned to start a trade shop which sold tibetan souvenirs and merchandise. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">'I'll have to start from there and go a long way to become a wealthy trader'.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">With these thoughts firmly etched in his mind, Daishin packed his goods, discarded his robe for a cheap suit and boarded the early bus that will take him to Nepal. The bus travelled down the friendship highway, which connected Lhasa all the way till Kathmandu. At Kathmandu, there would be stringent checking of the passenger visas by the border authorities. The secret route that Daishin planned to take started at Kodari, which was few kilometers before Kathmandu. The rickety journey by bus until Kodari would last for two days. Daishin waved his hands impassively to the vast grasslands and the mountain vistas that he was leaving behind. A german tourist seated next to him quipped, ' What a lovely place! Place of the gods indeed.". Daishin just smiled back. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">After an uneventful journey, the bus arrived at Kodari two days later. Daishin got down and decided to stay overnight at that place. The place was barren except for a very huge monastery that he spotted few miles ahead. He was afraid that nostalgia would get the better of him if he sought rest there. Having failed to locate an alternative to seek refuge, he trudged  towards the monastery through the heavy thickets of the Kathmandu valley. He noticed that the monastery rested on the slopes of the trail that he would have to take to reach Darjeeling. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">' Iam going to stay here only for the night. I would leave long before the first ray of sunlight stroke this place', he said to himself. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">It was dark by the time Daishin stepped into the monastery and the earthern lights made its walls reflect a sublime glow. The stupa stood there majestically, ornamented by the crested moon. The peace was so filling and the effect was magical. It hasn't been even two days and invisible strings were drawing Daishin towards the life of prayer and solitude. But he held on to his mission. If his ascetic life gave him the will power to abstain from a common man's desires, he could use the same will power to achieve the reverse effect. He walked up to a monk and asked him for a place to rest for the night. The monk took him to a huge hall where drifters were allowed to stay. The hall was empty save for a person huddled in a corner.  Willing for an acquaintance, Daishin sat next to the small man. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">'Where are you from?' Daishin asked boldly, a trifle too loud, which shook the meek man from his slump. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">'Iam Kokan, a trader from Darjeeling, on my way to Lhasa', he replied softly.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">'Oh, you are a trader. Good. What goods do you sell?'</span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">'Gems, souvenirs, perfumes and other antiques' </span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">'Do you have any of these with you now?", inquired Daishin, who was more eager to learn about the kind of goods that are in demand in India. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">'No i dont have anything with me right now', Kokan retorted to Daishin. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">'Thats strange. You dont look like a tourist and I assumed you were going to Lhasa for business"</span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">'Iam going to Lhasa to become a monk'</span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">'A monk? You want to become a monk?'</span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">'Yes'</span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">'But why?' asked Daishin, bewildered. 'You appear to be a man of means and why do you want to renounce it to lead a life of denial and contemplation?'</span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">'Denial and contemplation. Yes those are the words. Those are the words that will make the rest of my life rich. All this time, i was running behind money, gems and fame. I was like this free bird, always seeking better opportunities far and beyond. I started as a small trader. Over time I set up many trade shops, my business flourished. I thought i knew what i wanted, but it was all a big mistake.'</span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">'Did you suffer losses in your business? You are broke?'</span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">'Iam not broke, but i am a broken man. Fame and fortune is a bottomless pit. The way to it is deep, dark and limitless. I have been falling in this pit for years now. Nothing ever stops you.'</span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">Daishin became disturbed. Here he was, determined to bury his caged past and forge a free life. Kokan, on the other hand, was getting more determined by the minute, to become a monk. He was swelling up in confidence and resolve as Daishin tried to talk him out of it. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">'But what about freedom? Why do you want to spend the rest of your life in a cloister?'</span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">'Freedom.' Kokan repeated. 'Freedom only creates chaos.' </span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">Kokan stretched himself and laid down on the floor. He slept as soon as he hit the floor. Daishin  had the premonition that Kokan would have left before he woke up the next day. He was very tired and set off to sleep. He was not able to catch any sleep. 'Strange. All these years in the monastery, Of all the hardships i faced, i never faced a sleepless night.' Daishin was awake the whole night, making futile attempts to remember the ideas that he had for the future.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">The next morning, Daishin saw Kokan wake up and heed towards Lhasa. Daishin pretended to be asleep.  In one corner of his eye, he saw Kokan walk towards the rising sun. Kokan turned back and smiled, a smile of realization. As he continued walking, he heard someone shouting from behind. <div style="text-align: justify; display: inline !important; ">'Wait. Iam coming with you.', shouted Daishin running after Kokan. Kokan said nothing.</div></span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span"><div style="text-align: justify; display: inline !important; "><br /></div></span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span">Daishin and Kokan boarded the bus to Lhasa. The beauty of the rugged landscape was compounded by the inner peace that Daishin felt at that moment. They spoke nothing to each other, but it felt as if they knew the other person more than they knew themselves. The bus arrived at Lhasa and the driver woke up Daishin asking him to get down. Daishin searched for Kokan, the seat was empty and he was nowhere to be found. The driver asked, ' What are you looking for?'. Daishin stopped searching all of a sudden and stood transfixed. After some moments, he replied, ' Nothing. I think i found him.'</span></div><div style="text-align: justify; "><span class="Apple-style-span"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify; font-style: normal; "><br /></div></div></span>
