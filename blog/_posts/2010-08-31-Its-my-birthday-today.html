<div style="text-align: justify;">I dont know why, the last time i was  happy on a birthday was probably 10 years back. I have never figured out  a reason why birthdays have to rejoiced. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Hmmm  so last weekend, i was travelling most of the time. I attended the  alumni meet, met seniors/juniors apart from my classmates. Made a goof  up by entering a wrong hall which was hosting a different conference.  We(Bai/Suresh/Shyam/Me) thought it was the conference facilitating the  alumni until Uma Mam who was also sitting in the coference shooed us  out. She must have thought that even after two years we are still the  same jerks. (Now from which movie did i hear this dialogue - "If you  have to remain young, you have to make mistakes")</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">After  the alumni meeting, i headed to Vellore. Reached Katpadi Station in the  wee hours. Allvin was also arriving at the station in the next train.  So decided to wait for him. I had my first sleep on the platform. Wasnt  able to sleep well because of my loaded purse. I wish i was <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/greenerliving/7951968/The-man-who-lives-without-money.html">Mark Boyle</a>.  After an hour and half Allvin arrived at 12:40 a.m. By the time we  reached the mandap, it was 1:30. Poor Guru was awake becuase of us. We  then had our dinner. Guru served me this sweet liquid for rasam. I kept  cribbing saying that no rasam is sweet. But machan confidently asserted  that some rasams are sweet and asked me to eat it. Then Guru served the  same liquid for him, Machan nicely mixed the rasam with the rice will  all glee, rolled it into a huge ball and handed it into his mouth and  then,  i can n'er forget the reaction on his face. Finally it turned out  that the "rasam" was some kind of a sweet drink or something.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Next  day met Lingu/Sridhar/Gowri/Deepak/Vijay. We missed the wedding because  we woke up late. Then after breakfast we headed to Ambur to have  biriyani. Deepak dragged us through the Ambur markets to buy some shoes  then finally ended up buying nothing. After consuming meat, i bid  farewell to my friends and headed to Bangalore. </div>
