<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I have always been a news addict. Since childhood.<br /><br />And some time back I read this "news".<br /><br /><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/apr/12/news-is-bad-rolf-dobelli">http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/apr/12/news-is-bad-rolf-dobelli</a><br /><br />When I was growing up, "The Hindu" was the only source of news. I didn't watch news on TV and there was no internet.<br /><br />Even when electronic news arrived, I preferred reading hard copy of "The Hindu".<br /><br />But now, after coming to US, news consumption has changed for the worse. My focus has changed to NDTV, IBNLive, CNN, Google news etc. I am even addicted to watching Arnab Goswami's debates, mostly for comic relief. But that's certainly a new low.<br /><br />The article says "<span style="background-color: white; color: #666666; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">Out of the Â­10,000 news stories you may have read in the last 12 months, did even one allow you to make a better decision about a serious matter in your life".</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #666666; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br /></span>Seriously, I don't remember one. What I remember right now are how bombs and guns are going off in USA and how shitty governance is in India.<br /><br />So today, with the sacred sanctity of this blog as a sakshi, I make an oath to stop reading news for a week and then check how it has improved my life. I am sure if not anything else, I will get back a lot of time.<br /><br />Gradually, I would like to shift to reading hindu.com alone. And maybe economist.<br /><br />So that means, no reliance-owned media, no american news, no reddit, no checking news feeds in twitter and no quora(or &nbsp;maybe a little quora)<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
