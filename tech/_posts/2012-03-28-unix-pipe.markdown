Recently i did something like this,

[sourcecode] $> cat large.net | head -n 1 [/sourcecode]

large.net has a million lines, but the command line printed the output instantly. And thats when i wondered how unix pipes worked. And this [post](http://computinglife.wordpress.com/2009/04/17/unix-pipe-internals/) explains it. Brilliant.
