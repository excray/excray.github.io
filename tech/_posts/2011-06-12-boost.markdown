**Pointer Containers**

ptr_vec | ptr_map etc:

They are copy constructible and copy assignable. new_clone method has to be overridden if the concrete types are not known. That is the ptr_vec may be defined as pre_vec<A *> where A is an abstract class. Now if the ptr_vec is tried to be copied, it'll give compilation error since the concrete type is not known. Another way is to pass the customclonealloc param during the template declaration.

[sourcecode language="cpp"]
A* new_clone( const A& t )
{
    return t.clone();
}
[/sourcecode]
