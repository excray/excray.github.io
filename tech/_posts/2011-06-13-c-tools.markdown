Valgrind - Never used it. For detecting memory leaks.

CppCheck - Used it long time back. A neat static code analyzer. Now i wonder why i stopped using it.

GDB - Used it long time back. Really a tough thing to use.

Doxygen - Documentation tool for various languages.

msvsmon.exe - for remote debugging
